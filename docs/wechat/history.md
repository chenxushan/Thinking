“Forget all that and tune it out. All that matters is what you want to do. Where is the album going to end up In your mind?”
“忘掉这一切，把它调出来。重要的是你想做什么。这张专辑在你的脑海中会在哪里结束？

 
“A museum, but not an American one. It’s become clear to me how much the contents of this album still affect Chinese society. If you look online, it’s becoming a symbol of painful Chinese history, so it belongs there. No question about it.”
“一个博物馆，但不是美国的博物馆。我很清楚，这张专辑的内容对中国社会的影响有多大。如果你在网上看，它正在成为痛苦的中国历史的象征，所以它属于那里。毫无疑问。

Finalizing the album sale with the owner was accomplished by mid-September. I rang him on a disposable phone, laying it out plainly, "You do not want any part of this mess, believe me. I don't know the book's value, and the waters have become so murky, I can’t get anyone to give me an opinion and to be honest, I am terrified someone is going to steal it. How about I pay you a thousand dollars, donate it to China, and we call it a day?”
9月中旬，与所有者完成了专辑销售。我用一次性电话给他打电话，直截了当地说：“你不想让这个烂摊子成为其中的一部分，相信我。我不知道这本书的价值，水变得如此浑浊，我无法让任何人给我意见，说实话，我害怕有人会偷走它。我付给你一千美元，捐给中国，我们收工怎么样？

By November, we had reached an agreement to donate the album. The deal we were signing at Joe’s office detailed that I would retain the digital rights for educational purposes, while China would assume ownership of the physical album.
到11月，我们达成了捐赠专辑的协议。我们在乔的办公室签署的协议详细说明，我将保留用于教育目的的数字版权，而中国将承担实体专辑的所有权。

any triumph, and above all else, it hurt. A lot. Now, all I longed for was to restore my integrity and to have the truth acknowledged.
任何胜利，最重要的是，它很痛苦。好多。现在，我所渴望的只是恢复我的正直，让真相得到承认。

On Wednesday, November 16th, I arrived at Joe's office sporting a black suit, white shirt, and red tie to meet the Chinese officials flying in from Chicago. When they arrived, I read a letter explaining my actions before offering the book as a symbol of peace, harmony, and friendship. We shook hands, snapped a few pictures, and then the Chinese ambassador presented me with a letter of thanks from the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Chicago, as well as a porcelain tea jar, an enigmatic token that I didn't fully grasp but appreciated.
11月16日星期三，我穿着黑色西装、白色衬衫和红色领带来到乔的办公室，与从芝加哥飞来的中国官员会面。当他们到达时，我读了一封信，解释了我的行为，然后把这本书作为和平、和谐和友谊的象征。我们握了握手，拍了几张照片，然后中国大使向我赠送了中华人民共和国驻芝加哥总领事馆的感谢信，以及一个瓷茶壶，这是一个神秘的信物，我没有完全理解，但很感激。

Later that evening, in the solitude of my store, a feeling of vindication started to replace the weeks of turmoil and dread. I recorded a final statement to release online, packed up, and went to a five-star restaurant to celebrate with a close friend. That truly was the tastiest dinner of my life.
那天晚上晚些时候，在我店里的孤独中，一种平反的感觉开始取代数周的动荡和恐惧。我录了最后一句话在网上发布，收拾好行李，去一家五星级餐厅和一位密友庆祝。那真的是我一生中最美味的晚餐。

Sadly, it seemed my victory felt short-lived, for the internet's appetite for drama far outweighed its interest in resolution, and baseless accusations about me persisted. Much to my ire, no surge of attention came at the saga's onset, and no redemption arc played out in the public eye.
可悲的是，我的胜利似乎是短暂的，因为互联网对戏剧的胃口远远超过了它对解决的兴趣，对我的毫无根据的指责仍然存在。令我愤怒的是，这个传奇故事一开始并没有引起人们的关注，也没有在公众眼中上演救赎的弧线。


The story that had once consumed the world's attention quietly receded into the backdrop of an ever-churning news cycle. Only a handful of journalists reached out after the donation, almost exclusively from China, while the Western outlets that had fanned the flames of controversy remained conspicuously silent, failing to correct the dooming narrative they had helped shape. But one truth would leave me feeling vindicated, and that ultimately drowned out everything else.
这个曾经吸引世界注意力的故事悄悄地退居到一个不断翻腾的新闻周期的背景下。捐赠后，只有少数记者伸出援手，几乎全部来自中国，而煽风点火的西方媒体则明显保持沉默，未能纠正他们帮助塑造的注定的叙事。但有一个事实会让我觉得被证明是正确的，这最终淹没了其他一切。

When presented with the tea jar, the ambassador said, “This is a very important gift,” but he did not elaborate, and I didn’t think much of it. However, in the weeks following, I came to learn China had bestowed me one of their highest diplomatic honors. It wasn’t just a pretty porcelain piece. It was a National Gift, an accolade typically reserved for heads of state like Richard Nixon and Queen Elizabeth II. Unexpectedly, I found myself among such illustrious company, not for heroics in battle, or normalizing diplomatic relations, but for a TikTok that had accidentally educated millions. The tea jar, as I was told, was not just a token of respect but a lifeline for aid, should I ever need it; a “magic lamp,” if you will. I will never sell it, but I have been told it could command as much as one million dollars at auction.
当被赠送茶叶罐时，大使说，“这是一份非常重要的礼物”，但他没有详细说明，我也没有多想。然而，在接下来的几周里，我得知中国授予了我他们最高的外交荣誉之一。这不仅仅是一件漂亮的瓷器。这是一份国家礼物，通常是为理查德·尼克松和伊丽莎白二世女王等国家元首保留的荣誉。出乎意料的是，我发现自己跻身于如此杰出的公司之中，不是因为在战斗中的英勇表现，也不是因为外交关系正常化，而是因为一个意外教育了数百万人的 TikTok。正如我被告知的那样，茶罐不仅是尊重的象征，而且是我需要它时援助的生命线;一盏“魔灯”，如果你愿意的话。我永远不会卖掉它，但有人告诉我，它在拍卖会上的价格可能高达一百万美元。

This unprecedented turn of events, born from the depths of online infamy, became a defining moment in my life. Only the digital age could produce a story like this: a social media influencer named Pawn Man, who does not actually engage in Pawn loans, educated the world about the Nanjing Massacre using a photo album that did not actually contain photos of the event itself.
这一史无前例的转折，源于网络恶名的深渊，成为我生命中的决定性时刻。只有数字时代才能产生这样的故事：一位名叫“典当人”的社交媒体影响者，实际上并没有参与典当贷款，他使用一本实际上并不包含事件本身照片的相册向世界宣传南京大屠杀。

In September 2023, I was honored with an invitation from the Consulate General in Chicago to attend a function celebrating the 74th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. When the embassy staff saw me standing in line to enter the event, they promptly whisked me past security and ushered me right up to the Consulate General. It's a strange feeling bypassing a huge line, ushered past security, up to a top diplomat. When we shook hands, I joked, "Sir, it's the most midwestern thing imaginable to say, 'Thank you for your thank you,' but thank you for everything. Your letter and gift meant so much to me. I didn't donate the book for any reason other than the fact that doing the right thing knows no borders."
2023年9月，我荣幸地应驻芝加哥总领事馆的邀请，参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立74周年的活动。当大使馆工作人员看到我排队进入活动时，他们立即将我拽过安检，并把我带到总领事馆。这是一种奇怪的感觉，绕过一条巨大的队伍，穿过安检，到达一位高级外交官。当我们握手时，我开玩笑说：“先生，这是可以想象到的最中西部的事情，'谢谢你的感谢'，但谢谢你所做的一切。你的来信和礼物对我来说意义重大。我没有捐赠这本书，除了做正确的事不分国界之外，没有任何原因。

 

It’s been a year since the donation took place, and my perception of what all transpired has gained clarity in hindsight. It's nice to know I have allies for life, from the largest country on earth. I ended up in the hospital in the past year, and Chinese journalists and netizens were contacting me daily to make sure I was okay. It was a very curious thing, but it helped me recover almost as fast as the medical care I received. I’ve also become quite popular on Chinese social media. Whenever I sign on, I find myself staring at my own profile with a look of surprise, occasionally muttering, “How did I even do this?”
捐赠已经一年了，事后我对所发生的事情的看法变得更加清晰。很高兴知道我有来自地球上最大国家的终身盟友。在过去的一年里，我住进了医院，中国记者和网民每天都在联系我，以确保我没事。这是一件非常奇怪的事情，但它帮助我恢复得几乎和我接受的医疗护理一样快。我在中国社交媒体上也很受欢迎。每当我登录时，我都会发现自己盯着自己的个人资料，一脸惊讶，偶尔会嘟囔着：“我是怎么做到的？

The year 2023 has been marked by a strain in Sino-American relations, inadvertently positioning me at the forefront of an international discourse I never intended to join. It’s the reason why I waited a full year to release the full photo album online for all to see. Despite my best intentions, the conversations my actions have incited continue to cause unease, occasionally punctured by disquieting rumors that disturb the quiet of the night. While these whispers are, I hope, only speculation, they have put on hold my aspirations to visit China. Yet, there remains a hope—a hope that in time, I will journey there and experience its rich culture and warm people, unencumbered by scrutiny.
2023年是中美关系紧张的一年，无意中将我置于我从未打算加入的国际话语的最前沿。这就是为什么我等了整整一年才在网上发布完整的相册供所有人查看的原因。尽管我的意图是好的，但我的行为所煽动的对话继续引起不安，偶尔会被令人不安的谣言所打断，这些谣言扰乱了夜晚的宁静。虽然这些窃窃私语，我希望只是猜测，但它们搁置了我访问中国的愿望。然而，我仍然有一种希望——一种希望，随着时间的推移，我将前往那里，体验它丰富的文化和热情的人民，不受审查的阻碍。

In his letter to me, Consulate General Zhao Jian wrote, “History serves as a mirror for the people today and your donation certainly inspires everyone with a kind heart to safeguard peace.” I find myself staring at that letter when feeling down and it reminds me I weathered a storm for good reason. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn’t do anything differently. As I told The New Yorker in 2022, “If the conversation is genocide, and someone is being educated, then nothing is lost.”
赵健总领馆在给我的信中写道：“历史是当今人民的一面镜子，你们的捐款无疑激励着每一个善良的人维护和平。我发现自己情绪低落时盯着那封信，它提醒我，我有充分的理由经受住了风暴。如果我必须重新做一遍，我不会做任何不同的事情。正如我在 2022 年告诉《纽约客》的那样，“如果谈话是种族灭绝，并且有人正在接受教育，那么什么都不会丢失。
